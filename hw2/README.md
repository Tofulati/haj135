## 3rd Party Analytics
We had five different options that we checked for the 3rd party analytics: Umami, Cloudflare Analytics, Fathom Analyitics, UXCam, and Matomo. We found these analytics by seeing which analytics platforms were most popular with different well known webpages and other smaller, "start-up" webpages used. In order to evaluate which analytics platform we wanted to use, we based it off of how feature-rich the platform was with page interactions, while maintaining privacy and analytics depth. In addition, we wanted to check which level of analytics the platforms were at (either client or server sided.)

After deliberation, we wanted a platform that was lightweight, privacy-focused, and self-hosted, ensuring the data stayed within our control. For this reason, we chose Umami. With Umami, we liked how simple yet effective it was, providing meaningful aggregate metrics such as page views, referrers, device types, and location, without collecting personal data. Moreover, its lightweight design made it easy to integrate and maintain compared to more complex platforms like Matomo, while still giving us enough insight to monitor user interactions and site performance.
